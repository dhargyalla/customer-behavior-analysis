## üîç Project Steps

### 1. **Business Understanding**

* Defined 10 key business questions covering revenue, segmentation, product performance, and subscription behavior.
* Established analytical goals aligned with business strategy.

### 2. **Data Exploration (EDA)**

* Loaded dataset into Python using pandas.
* Conducted descriptive statistics and profiling (`df.describe()`, `df.info()`).
* Visualized key distributions and trends.

### 3. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

* Handled missing values in `review_rating` via median imputation per category.
* Standardized column names to snake_case.
* Removed redundant columns (`promo_code_used`).
* Created new features:

  * `age_group` (Young Adult, Adult, Middle-aged, Senior)
  * `purchase_frequency_days` (mapped from frequency terms)
* Integrated cleaned dataset into SQLite for query analysis.

### 4. **SQL-Based Data Analysis**

Executed SQL queries to answer business questions such as:

* Revenue by gender
* High-spending discount users
* Top 5 rated products
* Average purchase comparison by shipping type
* Subscriber vs non-subscriber spending
* Customer segmentation by purchase history
* Top products per category
* Age-group revenue contribution

**Deliverable:** Cleaned dataset and SQL query notebook/report

### 5. **Insight Generation**

**Key Findings:**

* Female customers contribute ~68% of total revenue.
* 839 customers spent above-average even after discounts.
* Express shipping slightly preferred over standard.
* Majority of customers are *loyal* (3,116 out of 3,900).
* Top-rated products: Gloves, Sandals, Boots, Hats, Skirts.
* Subscribers spend slightly less and contribute less revenue than non-subscribers.

**Deliverable:** Insight Summary Report

### 6. **Data Visualization (Tableau Dashboard)**

Developed an **interactive Tableau dashboard** to display:

* Revenue by gender, category, and age group
* Product rating and sales trends
* Customer segmentation distribution
* Subscription impact on revenue

**Deliverable:** Tableau Dashboard (`Customer_Shopping_Behavior_Dashboard.twbx`)

### 7. **Recommendations**

**Business Recommendations:**

* **Boost Subscriptions:** Introduce exclusive member offers to increase retention.
* **Loyalty Program:** Reward repeat buyers to strengthen the ‚ÄúLoyal‚Äù segment.
* **Optimize Discounts:** Review discount strategy to maintain profit margins.
* **Product Marketing:** Highlight top-rated and high-selling products in campaigns.
* **Targeted Marketing:** Focus efforts on high-revenue age groups and express-shipping customers.

**Deliverable:** Final Business Report & Presentation Deck
